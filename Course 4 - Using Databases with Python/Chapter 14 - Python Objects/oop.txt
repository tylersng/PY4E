Object Life Cycle:
Objects are created, used and discarded
We have methods for constructor and destructor

constructor:
Set up some instance variable to have proper initial values when created

destructor:
__del__( self) : to clean the memory when you override the variable 

Inheritence:
Extend the base class, a form of store and reuse avoid repeating
When we make a new class - we can reuse an existing class and inherit all the existing methods
